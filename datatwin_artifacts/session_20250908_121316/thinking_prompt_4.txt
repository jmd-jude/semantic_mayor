You have just run the following SQL query as part of your database exploration:

```sql
SELECT 
  GENDER,
  HOMEOWNER,
  PRES_KIDS,
  COUNT(*) as record_count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / 90424, 2) as pct_of_records,
  COUNT(DISTINCT INDIVIDUALID) as unique_individuals,
  SUM(TARGET) as successful_targets,
  ROUND(SUM(TARGET) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as success_rate_pct,
  ROUND(AVG(CONFIDENCE_LEVEL), 2) as avg_confidence
FROM DM_CAMPAIGN
WHERE GENDER IS NOT NULL AND HOMEOWNER IS NOT NULL AND PRES_KIDS IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY GENDER, HOMEOWNER, PRES_KIDS
ORDER BY success_rate_pct DESC, record_count DESC
```

Your initial reasoning was:
Given the extreme class imbalance (only 0.78% success rate), I need to identify which demographic segments have higher success rates to understand where the campaign is most effective. This query explores three key demographic dimensions (gender, homeowner status, presence of kids) to find patterns in the rare successful outcomes. By filtering out nulls and calculating success rates by segment, I can identify if certain demographic combinations are significantly more responsive than the overall 0.78% baseline. The confidence level average will also show if the model has different certainty levels across segments. This will reveal data coverage patterns across demographic segments and identify potential blind spots where certain combinations might be underrepresented, while also uncovering which customer profiles are most likely to respond positively to campaigns.

The query returned a DataFrame with 16 rows and 9 columns.
Here's a sample of the results (showing first 5 rows):

```
  GENDER HOMEOWNER  PRES_KIDS  RECORD_COUNT PCT_OF_RECORDS  UNIQUE_INDIVIDUALS  SUCCESSFUL_TARGETS SUCCESS_RATE_PCT AVG_CONFIDENCE
