You have just run the following SQL query as part of your database exploration:

```sql
SELECT 
  TARGET,
  COUNT(*) as record_count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / 90424, 2) as pct_of_records,
  COUNT(DISTINCT INDIVIDUALID) as unique_individuals,
  ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT INDIVIDUALID) * 100.0 / 71734, 2) as pct_of_individuals,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 1.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT INDIVIDUALID), 2) as avg_records_per_individual
FROM DM_CAMPAIGN
GROUP BY TARGET
ORDER BY TARGET
```

Your initial reasoning was:
I'm focusing on the TARGET column because it's likely the key outcome variable in this campaign dataset. Understanding the TARGET distribution will reveal:

1. **Campaign success rates**: What percentage of records/individuals represent successful outcomes vs. non-responses
2. **Data balance**: Whether this is a balanced dataset or if there's class imbalance that could affect analysis
3. **Engagement patterns**: How TARGET values correlate with the multi-record individuals we discovered
4. **Business context**: The TARGET values will help clarify what type of campaigns these are (response, purchase, conversion, etc.)

This query builds directly on our previous findings about record distribution by showing whether the 19.24% of individuals with multiple records have different TARGET patterns than single-record individuals. It's a critical step to understand the dataset's purpose and identify potential blind spots in campaign effectiveness measurement.

The metrics I'm calculating will show both record-level and individual-level TARGET distributions, plus the average records per individual by TARGET value - this will reveal if successful targets tend to have more campaign touchpoints.

The query returned a DataFrame with 2 rows and 6 columns.
Here's a sample of the results (showing first 2 rows):

```
   TARGET  RECORD_COUNT PCT_OF_RECORDS  UNIQUE_INDIVIDUALS PCT_OF_INDIVIDUALS AVG_RECORDS_PER_INDIVIDUAL
0       0         89715          99.22               71169              99.21                       1.26
1       1           709           0.78                 580               0.81                       1.22
```

And some basic statistics (limited to prevent context overflow):
```
         TARGET  RECORD_COUNT  UNIQUE_INDIVIDUALS
count  2.000000      2.000000            2.000000
mean   0.500000  45212.000000        35874.500000
std    0.707107  62936.746166        49913.960577
min    0.000000    709.000000          580.000000
25%    0.250000  22960.500000        18227.250000
50%    0.500000  45212.000000        35874.500000
75%    0.750000  67463.500000        53521.750000
max    1.000000  89715.000000        71169.000000
```
