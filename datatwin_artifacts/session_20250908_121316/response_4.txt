  "reasoning": "I'm focusing on the TARGET column because it's likely the key outcome variable in this campaign dataset. Understanding the TARGET distribution will reveal:\n\n1. **Campaign success rates**: What percentage of records/individuals represent successful outcomes vs. non-responses\n2. **Data balance**: Whether this is a balanced dataset or if there's class imbalance that could affect analysis\n3. **Engagement patterns**: How TARGET values correlate with the multi-record individuals we discovered\n4. **Business context**: The TARGET values will help clarify what type of campaigns these are (response, purchase, conversion, etc.)\n\nThis query builds directly on our previous findings about record distribution by showing whether the 19.24% of individuals with multiple records have different TARGET patterns than single-record individuals. It's a critical step to understand the dataset's purpose and identify potential blind spots in campaign effectiveness measurement.\n\nThe metrics I'm calculating will show both record-level and individual-level TARGET distributions, plus the average records per individual by TARGET value - this will reveal if successful targets tend to have more campaign touchpoints."
