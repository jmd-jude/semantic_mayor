  "reasoning": "After discovering that homeowner status '8' is a premium segment with 2x higher success rates, I want to explore the wealth/income dimensions to understand what drives campaign success beyond homeownership. This query will reveal:\n\n1. **Wealth-based segmentation patterns**: How age, income, and net worth combinations correlate with campaign success rates\n2. **Data coverage assessment**: Check for missing values in these key demographic fields and understand data completeness\n3. **Premium customer identification**: See if high-income/high-net-worth segments show similar outperformance to homeowner code '8'\n4. **Confidence score correlation**: Determine if wealth indicators also correlate with higher model confidence like homeowner status did\n5. **Segment size analysis**: Understand the volume vs. quality trade-offs across different wealth segments\n\nThis builds directly on our homeowner findings by expanding into the financial demographic dimensions. Since these are TEXT fields (surprisingly), I expect to see categorical values that may need decoding, similar to the homeowner codes. The combination of age + income + net worth should reveal the most valuable customer archetypes for targeting, helping explain why certain segments achieve 2-3x baseline success rates.\n\nLimiting to 20 results will show the top-performing segments while keeping the output manageable for analysis."
