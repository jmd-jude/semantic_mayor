You have just run the following SQL query as part of your database exploration:

```sql
SELECT 
  records_per_individual,
  COUNT(*) as num_individuals,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / 71734, 2) as pct_of_individuals,
  records_per_individual * COUNT(*) as total_records_in_group
FROM (
  SELECT INDIVIDUALID, COUNT(*) as records_per_individual
  FROM DM_CAMPAIGN
  GROUP BY INDIVIDUALID
) individual_counts
GROUP BY records_per_individual
ORDER BY records_per_individual
```

Your initial reasoning was:
This query directly addresses one of our key next directions: understanding the campaign multiplicity pattern. Since we know there are 90,424 records across 71,734 individuals (1.26 records per person average), I want to understand the distribution of records per individual. This will reveal:

1. **Data structure insights**: Are most people in the dataset once with a few appearing many times, or is it more evenly distributed?
2. **Campaign engagement patterns**: High-frequency individuals might be high-value customers or frequent campaign participants
3. **Data quality assessment**: Unusual patterns (like individuals with 50+ records) might indicate data issues
4. **Analysis implications**: Understanding this distribution will inform how to properly analyze campaign effectiveness

This foundational understanding of record distribution will guide whether we need to aggregate data at the individual level for certain analyses or if we can work with the raw records. It also helps identify potential outliers or data quality issues before diving deeper into campaign content and outcomes.

The query returned a DataFrame with 10 rows and 4 columns.
Here's a sample of the results (showing first 5 rows):

```
   RECORDS_PER_INDIVIDUAL  NUM_INDIVIDUALS PCT_OF_INDIVIDUALS  TOTAL_RECORDS_IN_GROUP
