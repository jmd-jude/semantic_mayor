EXPLORATION HISTORY:
=== Query 1 ===
SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records, COUNT(DISTINCT INDIVIDUALID) as unique_individuals, COUNT(INDIVIDUALID) as non_null_ids, (COUNT(*) - COUNT(INDIVIDUALID)) as null_ids FROM DM_CAMPAIGN

Result Summary: Query returned 1 rows with 4 columns. Numeric columns: TOTAL_RECORDS: min=90424, max=90424, avg=90424.00, UNIQUE_INDIVIDUALS: min=71734, max=71734, avg=71734.00, NON_NULL_IDS: min=90424, max=90424, avg=90424.00, NULL_IDS: min=0, max=0, avg=0.00. 

Thinking: ## Analysis of DM_CAMPAIGN Dataset Structure

### 1. What we learned:
- **Dataset size**: 90,424 total records across 71,734 unique individuals
- **Data completeness**: No null INDIVIDUALID values (excellent data quality)
- **Record distribution**: Multiple records per individual (90,424 รท 71,734 = ~1.26 records per person on average)

### 2. Implications:
- This is a **campaign interaction dataset**, not a simple customer master file - individuals appear multiple times
- The 18,690 "extra" records (90,424 - 71,734) indicate either:
  - Multiple campaigns per individual, or
  - Multiple touchpoints/responses within campaigns, or
  - Time-series data tracking campaign interactions over time
- **Clean data quality** with complete identifier coverage enables reliable individual-level analysis

### 3. Next directions:
- **Explore campaign multiplicity**: Query to understand how many campaigns/records per individual and the distribution
- **Identify time dimension**: Check for date fields to understand if this tracks campaigns over time
- **Campaign categorization**: Examine what types of campaigns exist and their frequency
- **Response/outcome analysis**: Look for success metrics or response indicators in the dataset

The multiple-records-per-individual pattern suggests this dataset will be valuable for analyzing campaign effectiveness and individual engagement patterns.

=== Query 2 ===
SQL: SELECT 
  records_per_individual,
  COUNT(*) as num_individuals,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / 71734, 2) as pct_of_individuals,
  records_per_individual * COUNT(*) as total_records_in_group
FROM (
  SELECT INDIVIDUALID, COUNT(*) as records_per_individual
  FROM DM_CAMPAIGN
  GROUP BY INDIVIDUALID
) individual_counts
GROUP BY records_per_individual
ORDER BY records_per_individual

Result Summary: Query returned 10 rows with 4 columns. Numeric columns: RECORDS_PER_INDIVIDUAL: min=1, max=12, avg=5.80, NUM_INDIVIDUALS: min=1, max=57929, avg=7173.40, TOTAL_RECORDS_IN_GROUP: min=7, max=57929, avg=9042.40. Categorical columns: PCT_OF_INDIVIDUALS top values: {Decimal('0.00'): 4, Decimal('80.76'): 1, Decimal('13.12'): 1, Decimal('5.67'): 1, Decimal('0.31'): 1}

Thinking: ## Analysis of Campaign Record Distribution

### 1. What we learned:
- **Highly skewed distribution**: 80.76% of individuals (57,929) appear exactly once in campaigns, while only 19.24% have multiple campaign records
- **Rapid drop-off pattern**: Multiple appearances decrease dramatically - 13.12% have 2 records, 5.67% have 3 records, then drops to <1% for 4+ records
- **Long tail exists**: Distribution extends to 12 records per individual, indicating some highly engaged participants
- **Data concentration**: The 57,929 single-record individuals account for 64% of all campaign records (57,929/90,424)

### 2. Implications:
- **Campaign strategy**: Most individuals are one-time campaign participants, suggesting either acquisition-focused campaigns or low repeat engagement
- **Customer segmentation opportunity**: The 13,805 multi-campaign individuals (19.24%) represent a distinct, potentially high-value segment worth analyzing separately
- **Data structure**: Clean distribution with no extreme outliers (max 12 records) indicates good data quality
- **Analysis approach**: Can work with raw records, but should consider individual-level aggregation for engagement analysis

### 3. Next directions:
- **Temporal analysis**: Examine if multi-record individuals represent repeat campaigns over time or simultaneous multi-channel campaigns
- **Multi-campaign segment deep dive**: Analyze the 13,805 repeat individuals - are they higher value customers or different campaign types?
- **Campaign type exploration**: Investigate if certain campaign types drive repeat participation
- **Outcome correlation**: Compare response rates between single vs. multi-campaign individuals

Based on the schema and previous exploration, generate:
1. The next SQL query to run (must be valid Snowflake SQL)
2. Your reasoning for choosing this query

Format your response as a JSON object with these keys:
- sql: The SQL query to execute

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Focus on understanding data coverage patterns and blind spots
- Look for interesting relationships between entities
- Seek to understand where data is rich vs. sparse
- Make each query build on what you've learned from previous ones
- Avoid repetitive queries that don't add new insights
- Ensure queries are valid Snowflake SQL
- Use LIMIT clauses to keep result sets manageable
