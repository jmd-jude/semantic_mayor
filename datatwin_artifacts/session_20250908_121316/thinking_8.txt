## Analysis of BUBBLES Field Results

### 1. What we learned:
- **BUBBLES is a lifestyle/behavioral segmentation system** with 61 distinct segments using descriptive names like "Hometown Heroes," "Social Climbers," "Jet Setters"
- **Success rates are consistently low across all segments** (1.62-2.06% for top performers), suggesting this segmentation isn't driving campaign effectiveness
- **"Jet Setters" is the largest valuable segment** (3,926 records, 77 successes) and shows strong correlation with age 35-44 (574 instances)
- **Homeowner status '8' appears rarely** across BUBBLES segments (max 31 in Jet Setters), suggesting these are orthogonal segmentation approaches
- **No data quality issues** - zero null values across all segments

### 2. Implications:
- The business uses sophisticated behavioral segmentation, but it's **not effectively predictive** for this campaign
- **"Jet Setters" + Age 35-44 combination** represents a potentially valuable micro-segment worth deeper analysis
- The **disconnect between behavioral segments and homeowner status** suggests the model may need to combine both demographic and psychographic features
- **Low confidence scores persist** even with behavioral segmentation, indicating the targeting challenge goes beyond just demographic vs. behavioral approaches

### 3. Next directions:
- **Analyze the "Jet Setters" + Age 35-44 intersection** specifically - this appears to be our strongest behavioral-demographic combination
- **Investigate interaction effects** between BUBBLES segments and homeowner status to see if certain combinations drive higher performance
- **Examine confidence score patterns** within top BUBBLES segments to understand if behavioral segmentation improves model certainty
- **Focus on segment size vs. performance trade-offs** to identify scalable targeting opportunities
