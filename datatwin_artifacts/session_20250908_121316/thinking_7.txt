## Analysis of Age-Based Campaign Performance

### 1. What we learned:
- **Age 35-44 dominates performance**: Highest success rate (1.08%) and absolute targets (162), representing 16.6% of records
- **Homeowner code '8' concentrates in younger segments**: 25-34 age group has 9.55% homeowner '8' penetration vs. 0.21-0.83% in older groups
- **Confidence scores decline with age**: From 0.19 (25-34) to 0.04 (65-74), suggesting model uncertainty increases with older demographics
- **Volume distribution is fairly even**: Most age groups have 14K-18K records, providing statistical significance

### 2. Implications:
- **Prime target identified**: 35-44 age group combines high volume (15K records) with best conversion, making it the optimal campaign focus
- **Wealth-age correlation exists**: Younger customers (25-34) have 40x higher concentration of premium homeowner status than seniors, but lower conversion rates
- **Model bias toward younger demographics**: Higher confidence scores for younger ages suggest training data skew or feature engineering issues
- **Lifecycle targeting opportunity**: Different value propositions needed across age segments

### 3. Next directions:
- **Deep-dive 35-44 segment**: Analyze other demographic/behavioral attributes within this high-performing age group
- **Investigate 25-34 homeowner '8' overlap**: Why do wealthy young customers have lower conversion despite premium status?
- **Confidence score investigation**: Examine what drives the dramatic confidence decline in older age groups
- **Cross-tabulate AGE Ã— HOMEOWNER**: Full matrix analysis to identify optimal age-wealth combinations
