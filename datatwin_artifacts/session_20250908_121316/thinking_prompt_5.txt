You have just run the following SQL query as part of your database exploration:

```sql
SELECT 
  HOMEOWNER,
  COUNT(*) as record_count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / 90424, 2) as pct_of_records,
  COUNT(DISTINCT INDIVIDUALID) as unique_individuals,
  SUM(TARGET) as successful_targets,
  ROUND(SUM(TARGET) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as success_rate_pct,
  ROUND(AVG(CONFIDENCE_LEVEL), 2) as avg_confidence
FROM DM_CAMPAIGN
WHERE HOMEOWNER IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY HOMEOWNER
ORDER BY success_rate_pct DESC
```

Your initial reasoning was:
From the previous query, I discovered that HOMEOWNER status appears to be a strong predictor of campaign success, with different codes ('8', '9', 'H', 'R') showing varying performance. However, these codes are cryptic and I need to understand what they represent and their individual impact on success rates. This query will:

1. **Decode homeowner status values**: Reveal all possible HOMEOWNER codes and their meanings through distribution patterns
2. **Isolate homeowner impact**: Remove the confounding effects of gender and kids presence to see pure homeowner status performance
3. **Identify data coverage**: Understand how much of the dataset has homeowner information and if there are data gaps
4. **Validate predictive power**: Confirm if homeowner status alone drives the success rate differences we observed
5. **Discover potential blind spots**: Check if certain homeowner categories are underrepresented or missing entirely

This builds directly on Query 4's finding that homeowner status matters significantly for campaign success, but now isolates this variable to understand its standalone predictive power and decode the mysterious status codes. Understanding these codes is crucial for actionable business insights about which customer segments to target.

The query returned a DataFrame with 4 rows and 7 columns.
Here's a sample of the results (showing first 4 rows):

```
  HOMEOWNER  RECORD_COUNT PCT_OF_RECORDS  UNIQUE_INDIVIDUALS  SUCCESSFUL_TARGETS SUCCESS_RATE_PCT AVG_CONFIDENCE
