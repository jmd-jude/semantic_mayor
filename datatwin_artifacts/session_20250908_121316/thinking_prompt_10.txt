You have just run the following SQL query as part of your database exploration:

```sql
SELECT 
  HOMEOWNER,
  AGE,
  CASE 
    WHEN CHILDRENS_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE IS NOT NULL THEN 'Children'
    WHEN HIGH_TICKET_FEMALE_APPAREL_ACC_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE IS NOT NULL THEN 'High-Ticket Female'
    WHEN HIGH_TICKET_HOME_DECOR_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE IS NOT NULL THEN 'High-Ticket Home'
    WHEN FASHION_ACCESSORIES_AND_BEAUTY_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE IS NOT NULL THEN 'Fashion/Beauty'
    WHEN HOME_DECOR_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE IS NOT NULL THEN 'Home Decor'
    ELSE 'Other/None'
  END as purchase_category,
  COUNT(*) as record_count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / 90424, 2) as pct_of_records,
  COUNT(DISTINCT INDIVIDUALID) as unique_individuals,
  SUM(TARGET) as successful_targets,
  ROUND(SUM(TARGET) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as success_rate_pct,
  ROUND(AVG(CONFIDENCE_LEVEL), 2) as avg_confidence
FROM DM_CAMPAIGN
WHERE HOMEOWNER IS NOT NULL AND AGE IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY HOMEOWNER, AGE, purchase_category
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 50  -- Filter for statistical significance
ORDER BY success_rate_pct DESC, record_count DESC
LIMIT 25
```

Your initial reasoning was:
This query combines our three most promising predictive dimensions (HOMEOWNER status, AGE, and purchase categories) to identify the highest-performing customer segments with sufficient volume for actionable targeting. 

From previous analysis, we know:
1. Homeowner code '8' dramatically outperforms (1.49% vs 0.71% baseline)
2. Age 35-44 is the top-performing age group (1.08% success rate)
3. High-ticket purchase categories (Female/Home) show 50-70% higher conversion rates
4. We need segments with sufficient volume (hence the HAVING COUNT(*) >= 50 filter)

This three-way intersection will reveal:
- Whether the premium homeowner '8' + age 35-44 + high-ticket purchase combinations create super-segments with even higher conversion rates
- If there are unexpected high-performing combinations we haven't identified
- The volume-quality trade-offs across different segment combinations
- Whether confidence scores improve when combining multiple predictive features

This is our final query, so it should synthesize our key learnings to identify the most actionable customer segments for campaign optimization. The HAVING clause ensures we only see segments large enough to be practically targetable, while the ORDER BY prioritizes both performance and scale.

The query returned a DataFrame with 25 rows and 9 columns.
Here's a sample of the results (showing first 5 rows):
