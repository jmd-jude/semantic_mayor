EXPLORATION HISTORY:
=== Query 1 ===
SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records, COUNT(DISTINCT INDIVIDUALID) as unique_individuals, COUNT(INDIVIDUALID) as non_null_ids, (COUNT(*) - COUNT(INDIVIDUALID)) as null_ids FROM DM_CAMPAIGN

Result Summary: Query returned 1 rows with 4 columns. Numeric columns: TOTAL_RECORDS: min=90424, max=90424, avg=90424.00, UNIQUE_INDIVIDUALS: min=71734, max=71734, avg=71734.00, NON_NULL_IDS: min=90424, max=90424, avg=90424.00, NULL_IDS: min=0, max=0, avg=0.00. 

Thinking: ## Analysis of DM_CAMPAIGN Dataset Structure

### 1. What we learned:
- **Dataset size**: 90,424 total records across 71,734 unique individuals
- **Data completeness**: No null INDIVIDUALID values (excellent data quality)
- **Record distribution**: Multiple records per individual (90,424 รท 71,734 = ~1.26 records per person on average)

### 2. Implications:
- This is a **campaign interaction dataset**, not a simple customer master file - individuals appear multiple times
- The 18,690 "extra" records (90,424 - 71,734) indicate either:
  - Multiple campaigns per individual, or
  - Multiple touchpoints/responses within campaigns, or
  - Time-series data tracking campaign interactions over time
- **Clean data quality** with complete identifier coverage enables reliable individual-level analysis

### 3. Next directions:
- **Explore campaign multiplicity**: Query to understand how many campaigns/records per individual and the distribution
- **Identify time dimension**: Check for date fields to understand if this tracks campaigns over time
- **Campaign categorization**: Examine what types of campaigns exist and their frequency
- **Response/outcome analysis**: Look for success metrics or response indicators in the dataset

The multiple-records-per-individual pattern suggests this dataset will be valuable for analyzing campaign effectiveness and individual engagement patterns.

=== Query 2 ===
SQL: SELECT 
  records_per_individual,
  COUNT(*) as num_individuals,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / 71734, 2) as pct_of_individuals,
  records_per_individual * COUNT(*) as total_records_in_group
FROM (
  SELECT INDIVIDUALID, COUNT(*) as records_per_individual
  FROM DM_CAMPAIGN
  GROUP BY INDIVIDUALID
) individual_counts
GROUP BY records_per_individual
ORDER BY records_per_individual

Result Summary: Query returned 10 rows with 4 columns. Numeric columns: RECORDS_PER_INDIVIDUAL: min=1, max=12, avg=5.80, NUM_INDIVIDUALS: min=1, max=57929, avg=7173.40, TOTAL_RECORDS_IN_GROUP: min=7, max=57929, avg=9042.40. Categorical columns: PCT_OF_INDIVIDUALS top values: {Decimal('0.00'): 4, Decimal('80.76'): 1, Decimal('13.12'): 1, Decimal('5.67'): 1, Decimal('0.31'): 1}

Thinking: ## Analysis of Campaign Record Distribution

### 1. What we learned:
- **Highly skewed distribution**: 80.76% of individuals (57,929) appear exactly once in campaigns, while only 19.24% have multiple campaign records
- **Rapid drop-off pattern**: Multiple appearances decrease dramatically - 13.12% have 2 records, 5.67% have 3 records, then drops to <1% for 4+ records
- **Long tail exists**: Distribution extends to 12 records per individual, indicating some highly engaged participants
- **Data concentration**: The 57,929 single-record individuals account for 64% of all campaign records (57,929/90,424)

### 2. Implications:
- **Campaign strategy**: Most individuals are one-time campaign participants, suggesting either acquisition-focused campaigns or low repeat engagement
- **Customer segmentation opportunity**: The 13,805 multi-campaign individuals (19.24%) represent a distinct, potentially high-value segment worth analyzing separately
- **Data structure**: Clean distribution with no extreme outliers (max 12 records) indicates good data quality
- **Analysis approach**: Can work with raw records, but should consider individual-level aggregation for engagement analysis

### 3. Next directions:
- **Temporal analysis**: Examine if multi-record individuals represent repeat campaigns over time or simultaneous multi-channel campaigns
- **Multi-campaign segment deep dive**: Analyze the 13,805 repeat individuals - are they higher value customers or different campaign types?
- **Campaign type exploration**: Investigate if certain campaign types drive repeat participation
- **Outcome correlation**: Compare response rates between single vs. multi-campaign individuals

=== Query 3 ===
SQL: SELECT 
  TARGET,
  COUNT(*) as record_count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / 90424, 2) as pct_of_records,
  COUNT(DISTINCT INDIVIDUALID) as unique_individuals,
  ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT INDIVIDUALID) * 100.0 / 71734, 2) as pct_of_individuals,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 1.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT INDIVIDUALID), 2) as avg_records_per_individual
FROM DM_CAMPAIGN
GROUP BY TARGET
ORDER BY TARGET

Result Summary: Query returned 2 rows with 6 columns. Numeric columns: TARGET: min=0, max=1, avg=0.50, RECORD_COUNT: min=709, max=89715, avg=45212.00, UNIQUE_INDIVIDUALS: min=580, max=71169, avg=35874.50. Categorical columns: PCT_OF_RECORDS top values: {Decimal('99.22'): 1, Decimal('0.78'): 1}, PCT_OF_INDIVIDUALS top values: {Decimal('99.21'): 1, Decimal('0.81'): 1}, AVG_RECORDS_PER_INDIVIDUAL top values: {Decimal('1.26'): 1, Decimal('1.22'): 1}

Thinking: ## Analysis of TARGET Distribution Results

### 1. What we learned:
- **Severe class imbalance**: Only 0.78% of records (709 out of 90,424) have TARGET=1, representing successful outcomes
- **Individual-level consistency**: The imbalance is nearly identical at individual level (0.81% vs 0.78%), indicating the imbalance isn't due to repeat records
- **Similar engagement patterns**: Both TARGET groups have comparable records per individual (1.26 vs 1.22), meaning successful targets don't receive significantly more campaign touches
- **High campaign failure rate**: 99.22% of all campaign records represent unsuccessful outcomes

### 2. Implications:
- This appears to be a **response/conversion campaign** with very low success rates, typical of direct marketing
- The dataset has **extreme class imbalance** that will require special handling for any predictive modeling
- **Campaign efficiency is poor**: Less than 1% success rate suggests either broad targeting or challenging conversion goals
- Multiple records per individual aren't concentrated among successful targets, indicating follow-up campaigns occur regardless of initial response

### 3. Next directions:
- **Temporal analysis**: Examine if successful targets (TARGET=1) show different timing patterns or seasonal trends
- **Feature correlation**: Identify which demographic/behavioral variables best distinguish the 0.81% successful individuals
- **Campaign sequence analysis**: For multi-record individuals, determine if there are patterns in the sequence leading to success
- **Cost-benefit analysis**: Calculate campaign ROI given the 99.22% non-response rate

The extreme rarity of positive outcomes makes this a classic "needle in haystack" scenario requiring focused analysis on what differentiates successful cases.

=== Query 4 ===
SQL: SELECT 
  GENDER,
  HOMEOWNER,
  PRES_KIDS,
  COUNT(*) as record_count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / 90424, 2) as pct_of_records,
  COUNT(DISTINCT INDIVIDUALID) as unique_individuals,
  SUM(TARGET) as successful_targets,
  ROUND(SUM(TARGET) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as success_rate_pct,
  ROUND(AVG(CONFIDENCE_LEVEL), 2) as avg_confidence
FROM DM_CAMPAIGN
WHERE GENDER IS NOT NULL AND HOMEOWNER IS NOT NULL AND PRES_KIDS IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY GENDER, HOMEOWNER, PRES_KIDS
ORDER BY success_rate_pct DESC, record_count DESC

Result Summary: Query returned 16 rows with 9 columns. Numeric columns: RECORD_COUNT: min=36, max=33276, avg=3835.31, UNIQUE_INDIVIDUALS: min=30, max=26851, avg=3055.19, SUCCESSFUL_TARGETS: min=0, max=208, avg=29.19. Categorical columns: GENDER top values: {'M': 8, 'F': 8}, HOMEOWNER top values: {'8': 4, '9': 4, 'H': 4, 'R': 4}, PRES_KIDS top values: {True: 8, False: 8}, PCT_OF_RECORDS top values: {Decimal('0.16'): 1, Decimal('0.13'): 1, Decimal('2.53'): 1, Decimal('1.23'): 1, Decimal('0.36'): 1}, SUCCESS_RATE_PCT top values: {Decimal('0.00'): 3, Decimal('2.03'): 1, Decimal('1.75'): 1, Decimal('1.70'): 1, Decimal('1.35'): 1}, AVG_CONFIDENCE top values: {Decimal('0.15'): 1, Decimal('0.31'): 1, Decimal('0.14'): 1, Decimal('0.34'): 1, Decimal('0.26'): 1}

Thinking: ## Analysis of Demographic Segmentation Results

### 1. What we learned:
- **Significant success rate variation**: Top segments achieve 2.03% and 1.75% success rates (2.6x and 2.2x the 0.78% baseline), while some segments have 0% success
- **Gender patterns**: Males with homeowner status "8" + kids show highest success (2.03%), suggesting this specific combination is most responsive
- **Homeowner status matters**: Status "H" (likely "Home") represents the largest segment (2,292 records, 2.53% of data) with strong performance (1.70% success rate)
- **Confidence levels are universally low**: Average confidence ranges only 0.14-0.34, indicating model uncertainty across all segments
- **Extreme segment size variation**: Largest segment has 33,276 records while smallest has only 36 records

### 2. Implications:
- **Clear targeting opportunities exist**: Certain demographic combinations are 2-3x more likely to succeed than baseline
- **Data quality concerns**: Very low confidence levels suggest the model may need improvement or feature engineering
- **Unbalanced representation**: Some demographic combinations are severely underrepresented (min 36 records), limiting statistical reliability
- **Homeowner status appears predictive**: Different homeowner codes show varying success patterns worth investigating

### 3. Next directions:
- **Decode homeowner status values**: Investigate what "8", "9", "H", "R" represent in HOMEOWNER field
- **Analyze confidence patterns**: Explore why confidence levels are so low and what drives the variation (0.14 vs 0.34)
- **Examine underrepresented segments**: Investigate the 0% success rate segments to understand if they're truly unresponsive or just small samples
- **Expand demographic analysis**: Include age, income, or other available demographic variables to build richer customer profiles

Based on the schema and previous exploration, generate:
1. The next SQL query to run (must be valid Snowflake SQL)
2. Your reasoning for choosing this query

Format your response as a JSON object with these keys:
- sql: The SQL query to execute
- reasoning: Your detailed reasoning for this query, explaining what you hope to learn

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Focus on understanding data coverage patterns and blind spots
- Look for interesting relationships between entities
- Seek to understand where data is rich vs. sparse
- Make each query build on what you've learned from previous ones
- Avoid repetitive queries that don't add new insights
- Ensure queries are valid Snowflake SQL
- Use LIMIT clauses to keep result sets manageable
