  "reasoning": "Given the extreme class imbalance (only 0.78% success rate), I need to identify which demographic segments have higher success rates to understand where the campaign is most effective. This query explores three key demographic dimensions (gender, homeowner status, presence of kids) to find patterns in the rare successful outcomes. By filtering out nulls and calculating success rates by segment, I can identify if certain demographic combinations are significantly more responsive than the overall 0.78% baseline. The confidence level average will also show if the model has different certainty levels across segments. This will reveal data coverage patterns across demographic segments and identify potential blind spots where certain combinations might be underrepresented, while also uncovering which customer profiles are most likely to respond positively to campaigns."
