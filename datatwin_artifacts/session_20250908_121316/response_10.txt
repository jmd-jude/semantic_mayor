  "reasoning": "This is my final query (9 of 10), so I want to explore the most untouched aspect of the database - the purchase recency fields. These 11 columns represent actual behavioral data (recent purchase history by category) which could be the missing piece explaining campaign success. My reasoning: 1) **Behavioral vs. Demographic Gap**: We've found that demographic segments (age 35-44, homeowner '8') and lifestyle segments (BUBBLES) have limited predictive power. Purchase recency represents actual transactional behavior which typically drives higher conversion rates. 2) **Recency is King in Direct Marketing**: Recent purchasers in specific categories are usually the highest-converting segments for related campaigns. 3) **Category-Specific Targeting**: Understanding which product categories drive success could reveal the campaign's true purpose (fashion, home goods, etc.). 4) **Data Coverage Assessment**: This will show us if purchase history data is sparse (many nulls) or rich, and whether certain categories dominate. 5) **Integration with Best Segments**: Cross-referencing with homeowner '8' and age 35-44 will show if our demographic winners also have specific purchase behaviors. This query will reveal whether the campaign is product-category driven (targeting recent buyers of specific items) rather than purely demographic, potentially explaining why traditional segmentation has shown limited predictive power."
