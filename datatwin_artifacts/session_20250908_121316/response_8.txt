  "reasoning": "After discovering that wealth-based micro-segmentation creates statistically insignificant sample sizes, I need to step back and analyze individual demographic dimensions with sufficient volume. AGE is a critical demographic variable that should have meaningful sample sizes per category. This query will:\n\n1. **Identify age-based success patterns** with statistically significant volumes, unlike the over-segmented wealth combinations\n2. **Cross-reference with homeowner code '8'** - our best-performing segment - to see if certain age groups correlate with this high-value homeowner status\n3. **Establish baseline age demographics** to understand the campaign's target population age distribution\n4. **Validate confidence score patterns** across age groups to see if the low confidence issue is universal or age-specific\n\nThis builds directly on previous findings by focusing on a single dimension (AGE) that should provide actionable insights with sufficient statistical power, while also exploring the relationship with our known high-performing homeowner segment. It addresses the key blind spot of understanding which age groups drive campaign success and whether the premium homeowner code '8' customers cluster in specific age ranges."
