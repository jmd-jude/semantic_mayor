You have just run the following SQL query as part of your database exploration:

```sql
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN CHILDRENS_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE IS NOT NULL THEN 'Children'
    WHEN FASHION_ACCESSORIES_AND_BEAUTY_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE IS NOT NULL THEN 'Fashion/Beauty'
    WHEN FEMALE_AND_MALE_APPAREL_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE IS NOT NULL THEN 'Apparel'
    WHEN HIGH_TICKET_FEMALE_APPAREL_ACC_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE IS NOT NULL THEN 'High-Ticket Female'
    WHEN HIGH_TICKET_HOME_DECOR_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE IS NOT NULL THEN 'High-Ticket Home'
    WHEN HOME_DECOR_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE IS NOT NULL THEN 'Home Decor'
    WHEN INTIMATE_APPAREL_AND_UNDERGARMENTS_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE IS NOT NULL THEN 'Intimate'
    WHEN KITCHEN_AND_BATH_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE IS NOT NULL THEN 'Kitchen/Bath'
    WHEN MALE_APPAREL_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE IS NOT NULL THEN 'Male Apparel'
    WHEN MODERN_CONTEMPORARY_DECOR_AND_GIFTS_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE IS NOT NULL THEN 'Modern Decor'
    WHEN OTHER_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE IS NOT NULL THEN 'Other'
    ELSE 'No Purchase History'
  END as purchase_category,
  COUNT(*) as record_count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / 90424, 2) as pct_of_records,
  COUNT(DISTINCT INDIVIDUALID) as unique_individuals,
  SUM(TARGET) as successful_targets,
  ROUND(SUM(TARGET) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as success_rate_pct,
  ROUND(AVG(CONFIDENCE_LEVEL), 2) as avg_confidence,
  -- Cross-reference with our best segments
  SUM(CASE WHEN HOMEOWNER = '8' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as homeowner_8_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN AGE = '35-44' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as age_35_44_count,
  -- Average recency values for non-null records
  ROUND(AVG(COALESCE(CHILDRENS_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE, FASHION_ACCESSORIES_AND_BEAUTY_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE, 
                     FEMALE_AND_MALE_APPAREL_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE, HIGH_TICKET_FEMALE_APPAREL_ACC_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE,
                     HIGH_TICKET_HOME_DECOR_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE, HOME_DECOR_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE,

                     MALE_APPAREL_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE, MODERN_CONTEMPORARY_DECOR_AND_GIFTS_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE,
                     OTHER_RECENCY_OF_PURCHASE)), 2) as avg_recency_days
FROM DM_CAMPAIGN
GROUP BY purchase_category
ORDER BY success_rate_pct DESC, record_count DESC
```

Your initial reasoning was:
This is my final query (9 of 10), so I want to explore the most untouched aspect of the database - the purchase recency fields. These 11 columns represent actual behavioral data (recent purchase history by category) which could be the missing piece explaining campaign success. My reasoning: 1) **Behavioral vs. Demographic Gap**: We've found that demographic segments (age 35-44, homeowner '8') and lifestyle segments (BUBBLES) have limited predictive power. Purchase recency represents actual transactional behavior which typically drives higher conversion rates. 2) **Recency is King in Direct Marketing**: Recent purchasers in specific categories are usually the highest-converting segments for related campaigns. 3) **Category-Specific Targeting**: Understanding which product categories drive success could reveal the campaign's true purpose (fashion, home goods, etc.). 4) **Data Coverage Assessment**: This will show us if purchase history data is sparse (many nulls) or rich, and whether certain categories dominate. 5) **Integration with Best Segments**: Cross-referencing with homeowner '8' and age 35-44 will show if our demographic winners also have specific purchase behaviors. This query will reveal whether the campaign is product-category driven (targeting recent buyers of specific items) rather than purely demographic, potentially explaining why traditional segmentation has shown limited predictive power.

The query returned a DataFrame with 12 rows and 10 columns.
