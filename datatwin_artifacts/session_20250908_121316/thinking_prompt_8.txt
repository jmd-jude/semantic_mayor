You have just run the following SQL query as part of your database exploration:

```sql
SELECT 
  BUBBLES,
  COUNT(*) as record_count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / 90424, 2) as pct_of_records,
  COUNT(DISTINCT INDIVIDUALID) as unique_individuals,
  SUM(TARGET) as successful_targets,
  ROUND(SUM(TARGET) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as success_rate_pct,
  ROUND(AVG(CONFIDENCE_LEVEL), 2) as avg_confidence,
  -- Cross-reference with our best performing segments
  SUM(CASE WHEN HOMEOWNER = '8' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as homeowner_8_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN AGE = '35-44' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as age_35_44_count,
  -- Check for null patterns
  SUM(CASE WHEN BUBBLES IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as null_bubbles_count
FROM DM_CAMPAIGN
GROUP BY BUBBLES
ORDER BY success_rate_pct DESC, record_count DESC
```

Your initial reasoning was:
After 7 queries focused on traditional demographics (age, homeowner status, gender, income), I want to explore the mysterious 'BUBBLES' field which hasn't been analyzed yet. This field name suggests it could be a behavioral segmentation or lifestyle clustering variable (like 'filter bubbles' or customer personas), which could provide entirely different insights than demographic variables.

Key reasons for this query:
1. **Unexplored dimension**: BUBBLES is the only major categorical field we haven't examined, and unusual field names often contain valuable business logic
2. **Potential behavioral segmentation**: The name suggests this might be a customer clustering or persona field that could outperform demographic segmentation
3. **Cross-reference with winners**: By including homeowner '8' and age 35-44 counts, I can see if our best-performing segments correlate with specific BUBBLES values
4. **Data completeness check**: Including null count will reveal if this field has coverage issues that might explain why it hasn't been used in modeling
5. **Alternative targeting approach**: If BUBBLES represents behavioral/psychographic segments, it might provide a completely different lens for campaign targeting beyond demographics

This query could reveal whether there's a behavioral segmentation system that's been overlooked, potentially explaining some of the low confidence scores we've seen if the model isn't leveraging this behavioral data effectively.

The query returned a DataFrame with 61 rows and 10 columns.
Here's a sample of the results (showing first 5 rows):
