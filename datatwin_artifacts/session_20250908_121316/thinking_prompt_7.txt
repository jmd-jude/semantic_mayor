You have just run the following SQL query as part of your database exploration:

```sql
SELECT 
  AGE,
  COUNT(*) as record_count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / 90424, 2) as pct_of_records,
  COUNT(DISTINCT INDIVIDUALID) as unique_individuals,
  SUM(TARGET) as successful_targets,
  ROUND(SUM(TARGET) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as success_rate_pct,
  ROUND(AVG(CONFIDENCE_LEVEL), 2) as avg_confidence,
  -- Homeowner code '8' overlap analysis
  SUM(CASE WHEN HOMEOWNER = '8' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as homeowner_8_count,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN HOMEOWNER = '8' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as pct_homeowner_8
FROM DM_CAMPAIGN
WHERE AGE IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY AGE
ORDER BY success_rate_pct DESC
```

Your initial reasoning was:
After discovering that wealth-based micro-segmentation creates statistically insignificant sample sizes, I need to step back and analyze individual demographic dimensions with sufficient volume. AGE is a critical demographic variable that should have meaningful sample sizes per category. This query will:

1. **Identify age-based success patterns** with statistically significant volumes, unlike the over-segmented wealth combinations
2. **Cross-reference with homeowner code '8'** - our best-performing segment - to see if certain age groups correlate with this high-value homeowner status
3. **Establish baseline age demographics** to understand the campaign's target population age distribution
4. **Validate confidence score patterns** across age groups to see if the low confidence issue is universal or age-specific

This builds directly on previous findings by focusing on a single dimension (AGE) that should provide actionable insights with sufficient statistical power, while also exploring the relationship with our known high-performing homeowner segment. It addresses the key blind spot of understanding which age groups drive campaign success and whether the premium homeowner code '8' customers cluster in specific age ranges.

The query returned a DataFrame with 7 rows and 9 columns.
Here's a sample of the results (showing first 5 rows):
