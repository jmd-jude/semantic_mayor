You have just run the following SQL query as part of your database exploration:

```sql
SELECT 
  AGE,
  HH_INCOME,
  NET_WORTH,
  COUNT(*) as record_count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / 90424, 2) as pct_of_records,
  COUNT(DISTINCT INDIVIDUALID) as unique_individuals,
  SUM(TARGET) as successful_targets,
  ROUND(SUM(TARGET) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as success_rate_pct,
  ROUND(AVG(CONFIDENCE_LEVEL), 2) as avg_confidence
FROM DM_CAMPAIGN
WHERE AGE IS NOT NULL AND HH_INCOME IS NOT NULL AND NET_WORTH IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY AGE, HH_INCOME, NET_WORTH
ORDER BY success_rate_pct DESC, record_count DESC
LIMIT 20
```

Your initial reasoning was:
After discovering that homeowner status '8' is a premium segment with 2x higher success rates, I want to explore the wealth/income dimensions to understand what drives campaign success beyond homeownership. This query will reveal:

1. **Wealth-based segmentation patterns**: How age, income, and net worth combinations correlate with campaign success rates
2. **Data coverage assessment**: Check for missing values in these key demographic fields and understand data completeness
3. **Premium customer identification**: See if high-income/high-net-worth segments show similar outperformance to homeowner code '8'
4. **Confidence score correlation**: Determine if wealth indicators also correlate with higher model confidence like homeowner status did
5. **Segment size analysis**: Understand the volume vs. quality trade-offs across different wealth segments

This builds directly on our homeowner findings by expanding into the financial demographic dimensions. Since these are TEXT fields (surprisingly), I expect to see categorical values that may need decoding, similar to the homeowner codes. The combination of age + income + net worth should reveal the most valuable customer archetypes for targeting, helping explain why certain segments achieve 2-3x baseline success rates.

Limiting to 20 results will show the top-performing segments while keeping the output manageable for analysis.

The query returned a DataFrame with 20 rows and 9 columns.
Here's a sample of the results (showing first 5 rows):

```
