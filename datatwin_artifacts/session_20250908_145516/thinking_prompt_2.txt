You have just run the following SQL query as part of your database exploration:

```sql
WITH aa_id_overlap AS (
  SELECT 
    'AA_SIGNAL_MATCH_HISTORY' as source_table,
    AA_ID
  FROM AA_SIGNAL_MATCH_HISTORY 
  WHERE AA_ID IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY AA_ID
  
  UNION ALL
  
  SELECT 
    'LAL_HISTORY_DETAIL' as source_table,
    AA_ID
  FROM LAL_HISTORY_DETAIL 
  WHERE AA_ID IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY AA_ID
  
  UNION ALL
  
  SELECT 
    'LAL_AA_FIELDS_EXTRACT' as source_table,
    AA_ID
  FROM LAL_AA_FIELDS_EXTRACT 
  WHERE AA_ID IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY AA_ID
),
aa_id_coverage AS (
  SELECT 
    AA_ID,
    COUNT(DISTINCT source_table) as table_count,
    LISTAGG(DISTINCT source_table, ', ') as present_in_tables
  FROM aa_id_overlap
  GROUP BY AA_ID
)
SELECT 
  table_count,
  present_in_tables,
  COUNT(*) as aa_id_count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as percentage
FROM aa_id_coverage
GROUP BY table_count, present_in_tables
ORDER BY table_count DESC, aa_id_count DESC
```

Your initial reasoning was:
This query investigates AA_ID overlap patterns across the three main tables that contain this identifier (AA_SIGNAL_MATCH_HISTORY, LAL_HISTORY_DETAIL, and LAL_AA_FIELDS_EXTRACT). Understanding this overlap is critical because: 1) It reveals data completeness - whether users exist in all systems or only specific ones, 2) It identifies potential data silos or integration gaps that could be blind spots, 3) It helps understand the relationship between the audience matching system (AA_SIGNAL_MATCH_HISTORY), the lookalike modeling system (LAL_HISTORY_DETAIL), and the profile data (LAL_AA_FIELDS_EXTRACT). Given that we saw different AA_ID counts in each table (155M, 18M, and 490M respectively), this analysis will show us whether these represent overlapping or distinct user populations, which is crucial for understanding data coverage and potential blind spots in cross-system user tracking.

The query returned a DataFrame with 15 rows and 4 columns.
Here's a sample of the results (showing first 5 rows):

```
   TABLE_COUNT                                                   PRESENT_IN_TABLES  AA_ID_COUNT PERCENTAGE
0            3  AA_SIGNAL_MATCH_HISTORY, LAL_HISTORY_DETAIL, LAL_AA_FIELDS_EXTRACT      7724149       1.47
1            3  LAL_HISTORY_DETAIL, AA_SIGNAL_MATCH_HISTORY, LAL_AA_FIELDS_EXTRACT      6598082       1.26
2            3  AA_SIGNAL_MATCH_HISTORY, LAL_AA_FIELDS_EXTRACT, LAL_HISTORY_DETAIL      5792236       1.10
3            3  LAL_HISTORY_DETAIL, LAL_AA_FIELDS_EXTRACT, AA_SIGNAL_MATCH_HISTORY      5539593       1.06
4            3  LAL_AA_FIELDS_EXTRACT, AA_SIGNAL_MATCH_HISTORY, LAL_HISTORY_DETAIL      4755354       0.91
```

And some basic statistics (limited to prevent context overflow):
```
       TABLE_COUNT   AA_ID_COUNT
count    15.000000  1.500000e+01
mean      2.200000  3.500341e+07
std       0.774597  9.087318e+07
min       1.000000  1.643892e+06
25%       2.000000  3.642910e+06
50%       2.000000  5.792236e+06
75%       3.000000  1.490203e+07
max       3.000000  3.589406e+08
```

Based on these results, provide your analysis in this format:
1. What we learned: Key insights from this query
2. Implications: What these results tell us about the data structure or business patterns
3. Next directions: What areas these results suggest we should explore next

Make your analysis specific to the actual data you see in the results, referring to concrete values and patterns.
Keep your response concise to avoid context length issues in future queries.
