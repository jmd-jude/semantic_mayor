  "reasoning": "This is my first exploration query to get a comprehensive overview of the database structure and data volume. I'm creating a unified view across all tables to understand: 1) The relative size of each table (total records), 2) The overlap potential between tables by counting unique identifiers (AA_ID/USERID, VISITOR_ID, TITLE_ID), 3) Data provider diversity across tables, and 4) Data freshness patterns through extraction timestamps. This will help me identify which tables are the primary data sources, which have the richest data, and where potential relationships exist. I notice the schema suggests this is a marketing/advertising analytics database with audience matching, closed-loop measurement, and email campaign data. Understanding the scale and key identifier distributions will guide my next queries toward exploring relationships and data quality patterns."
