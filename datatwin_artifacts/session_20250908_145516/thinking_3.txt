## Analysis of Single-Table Distribution and Data Provider Patterns

### 1. What we learned:

**Single-table isolation is extreme**: The 358.9M isolated AA_IDs break down as:
- LAL_AA_FIELDS_EXTRACT: 358.9M (dominates completely)
- LAL_HISTORY_DETAIL: 124.4M 
- AA_SIGNAL_MATCH_HISTORY: 50.2M

**Data provider specialization is stark**:
- Provider 2 dominates AA_SIGNAL_MATCH_HISTORY (119.8M unique IDs, 1.65B records)
- Provider 1 exclusively serves CLOSED_LOOP_DATA and REMAIL_LOG
- Providers 4-5 have much smaller footprints (40-42M IDs each)

### 2. Implications:

**LAL_AA_FIELDS_EXTRACT is a data silo**: With 358.9M isolated users, this table operates almost independently from the cross-table ecosystem, suggesting it serves a distinct business function (likely raw data extraction/staging).

**Provider-table coupling**: The data architecture shows strong provider specialization rather than redundancy - each provider appears to serve specific use cases rather than providing backup/validation data.

**Scale imbalance**: Provider 2's 1.65B records in signal matching vs Provider 1's 3.4M records in closed-loop suggests vastly different data collection capabilities or business focus.

### 3. Next directions:

1. **Investigate LAL_AA_FIELDS_EXTRACT purpose**: Why does this table have such massive isolation? Is it a staging area or separate product line?

2. **Analyze provider business models**: The 500x record volume difference between providers suggests different data types or collection methods - need to understand what each provider specializes in.

3. **Examine temporal patterns**: Check if the isolation is due to different time periods or if these represent parallel data streams.
