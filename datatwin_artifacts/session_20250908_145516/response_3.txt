  "reasoning": "This query investigates AA_ID overlap patterns across the three main tables that contain this identifier (AA_SIGNAL_MATCH_HISTORY, LAL_HISTORY_DETAIL, and LAL_AA_FIELDS_EXTRACT). Understanding this overlap is critical because: 1) It reveals data completeness - whether users exist in all systems or only specific ones, 2) It identifies potential data silos or integration gaps that could be blind spots, 3) It helps understand the relationship between the audience matching system (AA_SIGNAL_MATCH_HISTORY), the lookalike modeling system (LAL_HISTORY_DETAIL), and the profile data (LAL_AA_FIELDS_EXTRACT). Given that we saw different AA_ID counts in each table (155M, 18M, and 490M respectively), this analysis will show us whether these represent overlapping or distinct user populations, which is crucial for understanding data coverage and potential blind spots in cross-system user tracking."
