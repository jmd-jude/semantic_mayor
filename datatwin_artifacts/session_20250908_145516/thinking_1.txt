## Analysis of Database Overview Results

### 1. What we learned:
- **AA_SIGNAL_MATCH_HISTORY** is the dominant table with 2.03B records and 757M unique visitor IDs, suggesting it's the primary audience matching dataset
- **CLOSED_LOOP_DATA** has 679M records but the highest unique AA_ID count (212M), indicating rich user-level attribution data
- **LAL_AA_FIELDS_EXTRACT** contains 490M records with 1:1 AA_ID mapping (no duplicates), likely a reference/lookup table
- Data freshness varies significantly: CLOSED_LOOP_DATA spans 2.7 months while others cover ~2 weeks
- Limited title diversity: most tables cover 45-2,373 titles, but visitor scale is massive (18M-757M unique)

### 2. Implications:
- This is a large-scale audience measurement platform processing billions of interactions
- The 3-4 data providers per table suggests a multi-source data integration approach
- High visitor-to-AA_ID ratios (especially 757M visitors vs 155M AA_IDs in match history) indicate significant cross-device/identity resolution
- REMAIL_LOG's smaller scale (45M records, 64 titles) suggests it's campaign-specific rather than comprehensive tracking

### 3. Next directions:
- Investigate the relationship between AA_ID and VISITOR_ID across tables to understand identity resolution effectiveness
- Examine TITLE_ID overlap patterns to identify core vs. niche content properties
- Analyze DATA_PROVIDER_ID distribution to understand data source contributions
- Deep-dive into LAL_AA_FIELDS_EXTRACT structure since it appears to be a comprehensive user profile table
