You have just run the following SQL query as part of your database exploration:

```sql
WITH single_table_breakdown AS (
  SELECT 
    'AA_SIGNAL_MATCH_HISTORY' as table_name,
    AA_ID
  FROM AA_SIGNAL_MATCH_HISTORY 
  WHERE AA_ID IS NOT NULL
    AND AA_ID NOT IN (SELECT AA_ID FROM LAL_HISTORY_DETAIL WHERE AA_ID IS NOT NULL)
    AND AA_ID NOT IN (SELECT AA_ID FROM LAL_AA_FIELDS_EXTRACT WHERE AA_ID IS NOT NULL)
  
  UNION ALL
  
  SELECT 
    'LAL_HISTORY_DETAIL' as table_name,
    AA_ID
  FROM LAL_HISTORY_DETAIL 
  WHERE AA_ID IS NOT NULL
    AND AA_ID NOT IN (SELECT AA_ID FROM AA_SIGNAL_MATCH_HISTORY WHERE AA_ID IS NOT NULL)
    AND AA_ID NOT IN (SELECT AA_ID FROM LAL_AA_FIELDS_EXTRACT WHERE AA_ID IS NOT NULL)

    AND AA_ID NOT IN (SELECT AA_ID FROM LAL_HISTORY_DETAIL WHERE AA_ID IS NOT NULL)
),
data_provider_analysis AS (
  SELECT 
    'AA_SIGNAL_MATCH_HISTORY' as table_name,
    DATA_PROVIDER_ID,
    COUNT(DISTINCT AA_ID) as unique_aa_ids,
    COUNT(*) as total_records

    COUNT(DISTINCT USERID) as unique_aa_ids,
    COUNT(*) as total_records

  WHERE DATA_PROVIDER_ID IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY DATA_PROVIDER_ID
  
  UNION ALL

SELECT

  table_name,
  COUNT(*) as isolated_aa_ids,
  NULL as data_provider_id,
  NULL as unique_aa_ids,
  NULL as total_records
FROM single_table_breakdown
GROUP BY table_name

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'DATA_PROVIDER_ANALYSIS' as analysis_type,
  table_name,
  NULL as isolated_aa_ids,
  DATA_PROVIDER_ID,
  unique_aa_ids,
  total_records
FROM data_provider_analysis
ORDER BY analysis_type, table_name, data_provider_id
```

Your initial reasoning was:
This query addresses two critical blind spots identified in our previous exploration: 1) **Single-table AA_ID distribution**: We discovered that 68% of AA_IDs exist in only one table (358.9M records), but we don't know which specific table contains these isolated users. This breakdown will reveal whether LAL_AA_FIELDS_EXTRACT dominates the isolated users (as suspected) or if there's a more complex distribution pattern. 2) **Data provider contribution patterns**: Each table has 3-4 data providers, but we don't understand how these providers contribute differently across systems. This analysis will reveal whether certain providers specialize in specific data types (e.g., one provider dominates audience matching while another focuses on closed-loop attribution). Understanding these patterns is crucial because: - **Data quality assessment**: If one table has disproportionately isolated users, it suggests integration challenges or different data collection methodologies - **Provider specialization**: Different contribution patterns by provider could explain the fragmented user tracking we observed - **System architecture insights**: The distribution will help us understand whether the low cross-table overlap is by design (different use cases) or a technical limitation. This dual analysis will provide actionable insights into both the user coverage gaps and the underlying data sourcing strategy of this audience measurement platform.

The query returned a DataFrame with 17 rows and 6 columns.
