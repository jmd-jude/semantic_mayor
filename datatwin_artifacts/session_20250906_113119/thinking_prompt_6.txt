You have just run the following SQL query as part of your database exploration:

```sql
WITH confidence_analysis AS (
    SELECT 
        ROUND(CONFIDENCE_LEVEL, 2) as confidence_bin,
        COUNT(*) as total_attempts,
        SUM(CASE WHEN TARGET = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successes,
        COUNT(DISTINCT INDIVIDUALID) as unique_individuals,
        COUNT(CREDIT_RATING) as credit_data_points,
        COUNT(PART_AFFILIATION) as political_data_points,
        AVG(CASE WHEN HH_INCOME IS NOT NULL AND AGE IS NOT NULL AND GENDER IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as core_demo_coverage,
        MODE(BUBBLES) as most_common_bubble
    FROM DM_CAMPAIGN
    WHERE CONFIDENCE_LEVEL IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY ROUND(CONFIDENCE_LEVEL, 2)
),
confidence_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        confidence_bin,
        total_attempts,
        successes,
        ROUND((successes::FLOAT / total_attempts) * 100, 2) as success_rate,
        ROUND((credit_data_points::FLOAT / total_attempts) * 100, 2) as credit_coverage_pct,
        ROUND((political_data_points::FLOAT / total_attempts) * 100, 2) as political_coverage_pct,
        ROUND(core_demo_coverage * 100, 2) as core_demo_coverage_pct,
        most_common_bubble
    FROM confidence_analysis
)
SELECT *
FROM confidence_metrics
WHERE total_attempts >= 100  -- Filter for statistical significance
ORDER BY success_rate DESC
LIMIT 15
```

Your initial reasoning was:
This query aims to deeply analyze the relationship between confidence scores and various data completeness metrics, building on several key findings from previous queries:

1. We've seen that confidence scores correlate with success but haven't quantified this relationship precisely
2. We've observed varying data coverage across different fields
3. We've noted that some bubbles perform better than others

Specifically, this query will help us understand:

- The precise relationship between confidence scores and success rates
- Whether higher confidence scores correlate with better data coverage
- If certain bubbles are overrepresented in high-confidence predictions
- The minimum data requirements for high-confidence predictions

Key features of the query:
- Rounds confidence scores to reduce noise and create meaningful bins
- Calculates multiple coverage metrics (credit, political, core demographics)
- Filters for statistical significance (100+ attempts)
- Identifies the most common bubble for each confidence level

This analysis will help determine:
- Whether the confidence score is a reliable predictor of success
- If data completeness is a prerequisite for high confidence
- Whether the model shows bubble-specific bias in its confidence assignments

These insights could lead to practical improvements in the targeting model and data collection strategies.

The query returned a DataFrame with 3 rows and 8 columns.
Here's a sample of the results (showing first 3 rows):
