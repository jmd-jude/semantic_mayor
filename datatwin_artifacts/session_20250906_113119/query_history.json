The paradoxical relationship between confidence scores and data coverage:\n   - By breaking down data coverage into patterns (Both/Credit Only/Political Only/Neither), we can better understand if certain combinations of data are driving confidence scores\n   - This helps investigate why high-confidence predictions have lower data coverage\n\n2. Bubble-specific confidence patterns:\n   - Previous queries showed varying success rates across bubbles, but we haven't fully understood how confidence scores work within each bubble\n   - By examining confidence bins within bubbles, we can identify if the confidence score is more predictive in certain segments\n\n3. Demographic patterns in high-performing segments:\n   - Including typical_income, typical_age, and kids_ratio helps us understand the demographic makeup of successful segments\n   - This builds on our finding that certain bubbles (like Social Climbers) succeed despite low data coverage\n\n4. Contact intensity relationship:\n   - contacts_per_individual metric helps us understand if higher success rates are due to more attempts or better targeting\n   - This connects to our earlier finding about multiple contacts correlating with success\n\nThe query uses a minimum threshold of 50 attempts to ensure statistical significance while still capturing enough detail to spot patterns. The results should help us understand whether we need different confidence scoring approaches for different customer segments.",

Implications:\n- The confidence scoring system may be miscalibrated, as higher confidence bins aren't showing better success rates\n- The lack of credit/political data isn't necessarily a handicap for performance\n- The narrow range of contacts per individual suggests a standardized contact strategy\n- Success rates under 5% indicate a generally challenging campaign environment\n- Income segments J-O (higher income) dominate the top performers\n\n3. Next directions:\n- Investigate why Date Nights City Lights with confidence_bin=1 outperforms others\n- Analyze lower confidence bins to understand the full confidence-success relationship\n- Examine whether combining income and age patterns could yield better targeting\n- Look for cases where having more data (Credit/Political) actually helps performance\n- Consider whether the 50-attempt threshold is masking any important patterns\n\nThis analysis suggests we need to rethink our confidence scoring mechanism and possibly develop segment-specific approaches."
