  "reasoning": "This query builds on our previous findings in several important ways:\n\n1. We learned that bubbles seem to be a key targeting dimension (most individuals stay in one bubble), but we haven't analyzed bubble-specific performance.\n\n2. We discovered significant missing data patterns in credit_rating and political_affiliation, so this query examines if these gaps vary by bubble, which could indicate systematic data collection differences.\n\n3. Given the strong correlation between multiple contacts and success, we calculate avg_contacts_per_individual for each bubble to see if contact intensity varies systematically.\n\n4. We include demographic indicators (kids_ratio, typical_income) and confidence_level to understand if certain bubbles target specific demographic segments.\n\nSpecific insights we hope to gain:\n- Which bubbles have the highest success rates and how do they differ in contact strategy?\n- Are there systematic differences in data completeness across bubbles?\n- Do successful bubbles share common demographic characteristics?\n- Is there a relationship between confidence_level and success rate?\n\nThis analysis will help identify:\n- Most effective targeting segments\n- Data quality patterns across different customer segments\n- Whether successful bubbles share common characteristics that could inform future targeting\n- Potential bias in data collection across different customer segments"
