  "reasoning": "This query builds on our previous findings in several important ways:\n\n1. We learned that success rates vary significantly with contact sequence and that multiple contacts correlate with higher success. This query will help us understand:\n   - At which point in the contact sequence conversions typically happen\n   - Whether certain bubbles show different conversion patterns across the sequence\n   - The optimal timing between contacts for successful conversions\n\n2. We discovered that confidence levels might correlate with success rates, but we haven't seen how this plays out across the contact sequence. This query will reveal:\n   - Whether confidence levels predict success differently at different stages\n   - If certain bubbles maintain consistent confidence across contacts\n   - The relationship between contact timing and confidence levels\n\n3. Previous queries showed varying success rates across bubbles, but we haven't understood the temporal dynamics. This analysis will show:\n   - Which bubbles are most effective at early vs. late-stage conversion\n   - The optimal number of contacts for different bubbles\n   - Whether rapid follow-up correlates with higher success rates\n\n4. We're focusing on cases with 2-5 contacts because:\n   - Previous analysis showed these cases have higher success rates\n   - They represent a significant but manageable subset of the data\n   - They allow us to see clear patterns in sequential contacts\n\nThe HAVING clause ensures we only look at segments with enough data to draw meaningful conclusions, while the LIMIT keeps the result set manageable while focusing on the highest-performing segments."
