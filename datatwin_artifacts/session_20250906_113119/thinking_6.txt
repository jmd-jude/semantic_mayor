Here's my analysis of the results:

1. What we learned:
- Contrary to expectations, higher confidence scores show only marginally better success rates (1.23% at confidence=2 vs 0.75% at confidence=0)
- Data coverage paradoxically decreases with confidence (96.23% core demo coverage at confidence=0 vs 40.10% at confidence=2)
- "Life in the Fast Lane" bubble dominates high-confidence predictions, while "Wealth Whispers" is most common in low-confidence ones
- The vast majority of predictions (84,099 out of 90,424) are made with confidence=0

2. Implications:
- The confidence score appears to be a weak predictor of actual success
- The model might be overly conservative, assigning low confidence even when it has complete data
- There may be a systematic bias in how confidence is assigned across different bubbles
- The current confidence scoring system may need recalibration given the inverse relationship with data completeness

3. Next directions:
- Analyze success rates within each bubble separately to identify if confidence scores work better for specific segments
- Investigate why high-confidence predictions have lower data coverage
- Examine the specific combinations of features present in high-confidence, successful predictions
- Consider creating a new confidence metric that better correlates with success rates

Would you like me to focus on any of these aspects in particular for the next query?
