Here's my analysis of the results:

1. What we learned:
- Success rates are generally low (1.19-2.62%) across all bubbles
- Top performers (Social Climbers, Hometown Heroes, Jet Setters) have success rates >2.4%
- Contact intensity is fairly consistent (1.2-1.33 contacts per individual)
- Data coverage varies significantly:
  * Credit coverage: 69-77%
  * Political coverage: much more variable (11-67%)
- All shown bubbles have the same typical income category ('O')
- Confidence levels are surprisingly low (0.09-0.22)

2. Implications:
- The narrow range in avg_contacts_per_individual suggests a standardized contact strategy
- The large variation in political_coverage (especially Social Climbers at 11%) indicates systematic data collection differences between bubbles
- Success rates don't seem strongly correlated with bubble size (Jet Setters has high volume and success rate)
- Higher confidence levels might correlate with success (Jet Setters has highest confidence at 0.22)

3. Next directions:
- Analyze why Social Climbers succeeds despite low political coverage
- Investigate if there's a statistical correlation between confidence levels and success rates
- Look for patterns in the timing/sequence of contacts in high-performing bubbles
- Examine whether the consistent typical_income ('O') holds true for lower-performing bubbles not shown in this sample

This focused analysis suggests targeting effectiveness varies more by bubble characteristics than contact intensity.
