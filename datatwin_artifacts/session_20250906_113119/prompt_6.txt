EXPLORATION HISTORY:
=== Query 1 ===
SQL: SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(DISTINCT INDIVIDUALID) as unique_individuals,
    SUM(CASE WHEN TARGET = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as target_count,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN TARGET = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100, 2) as target_percentage,
    COUNT(GENDER) as gender_count,
    COUNT(AGE) as age_count,
    COUNT(HH_INCOME) as income_count,
    COUNT(CREDIT_RATING) as credit_rating_count,
    COUNT(PART_AFFILIATION) as political_affiliation_count
  FROM DM_CAMPAIGN

Result Summary: Query returned 1 rows with 9 columns. Numeric columns: TOTAL_RECORDS: min=90424, max=90424, avg=90424.00, UNIQUE_INDIVIDUALS: min=71734, max=71734, avg=71734.00, TARGET_COUNT: min=709, max=709, avg=709.00, GENDER_COUNT: min=89962, max=89962, avg=89962.00, AGE_COUNT: min=88065, max=88065, avg=88065.00, INCOME_COUNT: min=85265, max=85265, avg=85265.00, CREDIT_RATING_COUNT: min=62780, max=62780, avg=62780.00, POLITICAL_AFFILIATION_COUNT: min=52580, max=52580, avg=52580.00. Categorical columns: TARGET_PERCENTAGE top values: {Decimal('0.78'): 1}

Thinking: 1. What we learned:
- Dataset has 90,424 records but only 71,734 unique individuals, indicating multiple records per person
- Very low target rate (0.78%, 709 positive cases)
- Missing data varies by field:
  * Gender: 462 missing (99.5% complete)
  * Age: 2,359 missing (97.4% complete)
  * Income: 5,159 missing (94.3% complete)
  * Credit Rating: 27,644 missing (69.4% complete)
  * Political Affiliation: 37,844 missing (58.1% complete)

2. Implications:
- Significant data quality issues in credit rating and political affiliation fields
- Severe class imbalance in target variable will require special handling
- Average of 1.26 records per individual (90,424/71,734) suggests repeated interactions
- Basic demographic data (gender, age, income) is relatively complete

3. Next directions:
1. Investigate why individuals have multiple records (time patterns, campaign patterns)
2. Analyze if missing credit/political data correlates with target variable
3. Examine characteristics of the 709 positive cases to understand success patterns
4. Look for temporal patterns in the data to understand if target rate varies over time

Would you like me to focus on any of these directions for the next query?

=== Query 2 ===
SQL: WITH individual_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        INDIVIDUALID,
        COUNT(*) as record_count,
        SUM(CASE WHEN TARGET = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as success_count,
        MIN(PURCHASE_DATE_RANGE) as first_purchase,
        MAX(PURCHASE_DATE_RANGE) as last_purchase,
        COUNT(DISTINCT BUBBLES) as unique_bubbles
    FROM DM_CAMPAIGN
    GROUP BY INDIVIDUALID
)
SELECT 
    record_count,
    COUNT(*) as num_individuals,
    SUM(success_count) as total_successes,
    ROUND(AVG(success_count) * 100, 2) as success_rate,
    AVG(last_purchase - first_purchase) as avg_date_range,
    AVG(unique_bubbles) as avg_unique_bubbles
FROM individual_stats
GROUP BY record_count
ORDER BY record_count
LIMIT 20

Result Summary: Query returned 10 rows with 6 columns. Numeric columns: RECORD_COUNT: min=1, max=12, avg=5.80, NUM_INDIVIDUALS: min=1, max=57929, avg=7173.40, TOTAL_SUCCESSES: min=0, max=474, avg=70.90. Categorical columns: SUCCESS_RATE top values: {Decimal('0.00'): 4, Decimal('0.82'): 1, Decimal('1.56'): 1, Decimal('1.18'): 1, Decimal('9.46'): 1}, AVG_DATE_RANGE top values: {Decimal('0.000000'): 2, Decimal('0.026313'): 1, Decimal('0.009125'): 1, Decimal('0.328358'): 1, Decimal('0.103448'): 1}, AVG_UNIQUE_BUBBLES top values: {Decimal('1.000000'): 9, Decimal('0.999983'): 1}

Thinking: 1. What we learned:
- Strong skew in contact frequency: 57,929 individuals (majority) have single contact, dropping sharply to 9,412 with two contacts
- Success rate pattern is notable: increases from 0.82% (single contact) to 22.73% (five contacts)
- Average date range is mostly small (mostly <0.33), suggesting clustered contacts
- Consistently seeing avg_unique_bubbles â‰ˆ 1, indicating minimal bubble diversity per individual

2. Implications:
- Campaign appears to be primarily single-touch, with selective multiple contacts
- Multiple contacts correlate strongly with higher success (22.73% vs 0.82%), suggesting potential benefits of follow-up
- Short date ranges indicate rapid follow-up strategy rather than long-term nurturing
- Single-bubble targeting suggests specialized/focused campaign approach rather than cross-category marketing

3. Next directions:
- Analyze the timing between contacts for multi-contact individuals
- Investigate which specific bubbles are associated with higher success rates
- Examine whether successful conversions typically occur early or late in contact sequence
- Study characteristics of individuals receiving 4-5 contacts (high success group) vs single contacts

This suggests focusing next query on temporal patterns and bubble-specific success rates, particularly for multi-contact cases.

=== Query 3 ===
SQL: WITH bubble_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        BUBBLES,
        COUNT(*) as total_contacts,
        COUNT(DISTINCT INDIVIDUALID) as unique_individuals,
        SUM(CASE WHEN TARGET = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successes,
        AVG(CONFIDENCE_LEVEL) as avg_confidence,
        COUNT(CREDIT_RATING) / COUNT(*) as credit_coverage,
        COUNT(PART_AFFILIATION) / COUNT(*) as political_coverage,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN PRES_KIDS = TRUE THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*) as kids_ratio,
        MODE(HH_INCOME) as typical_income
    FROM DM_CAMPAIGN
    GROUP BY BUBBLES
),
bubble_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        *,
        ROUND((successes::FLOAT / unique_individuals) * 100, 2) as success_rate,
        ROUND((total_contacts::FLOAT / unique_individuals), 2) as avg_contacts_per_individual
    FROM bubble_stats
)
SELECT *
FROM bubble_metrics
ORDER BY success_rate DESC
LIMIT 15

Result Summary: Query returned 15 rows with 11 columns. Numeric columns: TOTAL_CONTACTS: min=323, max=5245, avg=2111.60, UNIQUE_INDIVIDUALS: min=252, max=4015, avg=1655.67, SUCCESSES: min=3, max=77, avg=28.47, SUCCESS_RATE: min=1.19, max=2.62, avg=1.75, AVG_CONTACTS_PER_INDIVIDUAL: min=1.2, max=1.33, avg=1.27. Categorical columns: BUBBLES top values: {'Social Climbers': 1, 'Hometown Heroes': 1, 'Jet Setters': 1, 'Single and Thriving': 1, 'Urban Elites': 1}, AVG_CONFIDENCE top values: {Decimal('0.127789'): 1, Decimal('0.095116'): 1, Decimal('0.216251'): 1, Decimal('0.178891'): 1, Decimal('0.156627'): 1}, CREDIT_COVERAGE top values: {Decimal('0.724138'): 1, Decimal('0.706941'): 1, Decimal('0.690779'): 1, Decimal('0.725523'): 1, Decimal('0.774408'): 1}, POLITICAL_COVERAGE top values: {Decimal('0.111562'): 1, Decimal('0.637532'): 1, Decimal('0.519103'): 1, Decimal('0.611351'): 1, Decimal('0.674699'): 1}, KIDS_RATIO top values: {Decimal('0.892495'): 1, Decimal('0.586118'): 1, Decimal('0.655629'): 1, Decimal('0.537670'): 1, Decimal('0.321978'): 1}, TYPICAL_INCOME top values: {'O': 10, 'N': 3, 'H': 2}

Thinking: Here's my analysis of the results:

1. What we learned:
- Success rates are generally low (1.19-2.62%) across all bubbles
- Top performers (Social Climbers, Hometown Heroes, Jet Setters) have success rates >2.4%
- Contact intensity is fairly consistent (1.2-1.33 contacts per individual)
- Data coverage varies significantly:
  * Credit coverage: 69-77%
  * Political coverage: much more variable (11-67%)
- All shown bubbles have the same typical income category ('O')
- Confidence levels are surprisingly low (0.09-0.22)

2. Implications:
- The narrow range in avg_contacts_per_individual suggests a standardized contact strategy
- The large variation in political_coverage (especially Social Climbers at 11%) indicates systematic data collection differences between bubbles
- Success rates don't seem strongly correlated with bubble size (Jet Setters has high volume and success rate)
- Higher confidence levels might correlate with success (Jet Setters has highest confidence at 0.22)

3. Next directions:
- Analyze why Social Climbers succeeds despite low political coverage
- Investigate if there's a statistical correlation between confidence levels and success rates
- Look for patterns in the timing/sequence of contacts in high-performing bubbles
- Examine whether the consistent typical_income ('O') holds true for lower-performing bubbles not shown in this sample

This focused analysis suggests targeting effectiveness varies more by bubble characteristics than contact intensity.
