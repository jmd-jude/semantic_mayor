You have just run the following SQL query as part of your database exploration:

```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(DISTINCT INDIVIDUALID) as unique_individuals,
    SUM(CASE WHEN TARGET = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as target_count,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN TARGET = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100, 2) as target_percentage,
    COUNT(GENDER) as gender_count,
    COUNT(AGE) as age_count,
    COUNT(HH_INCOME) as income_count,
    COUNT(CREDIT_RATING) as credit_rating_count,
    COUNT(PART_AFFILIATION) as political_affiliation_count
  FROM DM_CAMPAIGN
```

Your initial reasoning was:
As this is the first query, we should start with a high-level overview of the dataset to understand:
  1. The total size of the dataset and number of unique individuals
  2. The distribution of the target variable (which appears to be a binary classification target)
  3. The completeness of key demographic fields (gender, age, income, credit rating, political affiliation)
  
  This will help us:
  - Identify if we have duplicate individuals in the dataset
  - Understand the class balance of our target variable
  - Spot which demographic fields might have missing data issues
  - Get a sense of the overall data quality and completeness
  
  This foundation will guide our subsequent queries to dive deeper into specific patterns or issues we discover. For example, if we find a high number of missing values in certain fields, we might want to investigate those specifically in our next query.

The query returned a DataFrame with 1 rows and 9 columns.
Here's a sample of the results (showing first 1 rows):

```
   TOTAL_RECORDS  UNIQUE_INDIVIDUALS  TARGET_COUNT TARGET_PERCENTAGE  GENDER_COUNT  AGE_COUNT  INCOME_COUNT  CREDIT_RATING_COUNT  POLITICAL_AFFILIATION_COUNT
0          90424               71734           709              0.78         89962      88065         85265                62780                        52580
```

And some basic statistics (limited to prevent context overflow):
