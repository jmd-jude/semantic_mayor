Here's my analysis based on the provided results:

1. What we learned:
- Surprisingly, the highest success rates are quite low (max 5.06% for Date Nights City Lights)
- All top 5 segments show "Neither" for data coverage pattern, contradicting what we might expect
- Confidence bins are clustered (mostly 2.0), suggesting limited differentiation
- Contact rates are consistently narrow (1.25-1.35 contacts per individual)
- Age patterns vary widely in top performers (25-34 to 75+)

2. Implications:
- The confidence scoring system may be miscalibrated, as higher confidence bins aren't showing better success rates
- The lack of credit/political data isn't necessarily a handicap for performance
- The narrow range of contacts per individual suggests a standardized contact strategy
- Success rates under 5% indicate a generally challenging campaign environment
- Income segments J-O (higher income) dominate the top performers

3. Next directions:
- Investigate why Date Nights City Lights with confidence_bin=1 outperforms others
- Analyze lower confidence bins to understand the full confidence-success relationship
- Examine whether combining income and age patterns could yield better targeting
- Look for cases where having more data (Credit/Political) actually helps performance
- Consider whether the 50-attempt threshold is masking any important patterns

This analysis suggests we need to rethink our confidence scoring mechanism and possibly develop segment-specific approaches.
