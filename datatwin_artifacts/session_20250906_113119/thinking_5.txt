Here's my analysis of the results:

1. What we learned:
- Data coverage is consistently high for basic demographics (gender ~99%, age ~97%, income ~94%) regardless of contact frequency
- Much lower coverage for political affiliation (~55%) and credit rating (~68%)
- Confidence scores are consistently higher for successful contacts (0.200 vs 0.123 for single contacts)
- The vast majority of cases are in lower contact frequencies (57,455 single-contact failures vs only 474 successes)

2. Implications:
- The campaign has strong baseline data collection practices for fundamental demographics
- Lower coverage of credit/political data suggests these are supplemental data sources rather than primary collection
- Higher confidence scores in successful cases implies the targeting model is working, but could be more aggressive
- The large disparity in group sizes between successes/failures indicates potential targeting inefficiency

3. Next directions:
- Analyze the relationship between confidence scores and actual success rates to validate the model's effectiveness
- Investigate cases with high confidence scores that failed to understand why the model's prediction was incorrect
- Examine whether combining credit and political data coverage improves success prediction
- Look into whether certain demographic combinations yield better success rates

This analysis suggests the campaign has good basic data practices but could improve its targeting efficiency by better leveraging the confidence scores and supplemental data sources.
