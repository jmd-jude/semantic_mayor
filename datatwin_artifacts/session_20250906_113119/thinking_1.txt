1. What we learned:
- Dataset has 90,424 records but only 71,734 unique individuals, indicating multiple records per person
- Very low target rate (0.78%, 709 positive cases)
- Missing data varies by field:
  * Gender: 462 missing (99.5% complete)
  * Age: 2,359 missing (97.4% complete)
  * Income: 5,159 missing (94.3% complete)
  * Credit Rating: 27,644 missing (69.4% complete)
  * Political Affiliation: 37,844 missing (58.1% complete)

2. Implications:
- Significant data quality issues in credit rating and political affiliation fields
- Severe class imbalance in target variable will require special handling
- Average of 1.26 records per individual (90,424/71,734) suggests repeated interactions
- Basic demographic data (gender, age, income) is relatively complete

3. Next directions:
1. Investigate why individuals have multiple records (time patterns, campaign patterns)
2. Analyze if missing credit/political data correlates with target variable
3. Examine characteristics of the 709 positive cases to understand success patterns
4. Look for temporal patterns in the data to understand if target rate varies over time

Would you like me to focus on any of these directions for the next query?
