You have just run the following SQL query as part of your database exploration:

```sql
WITH individual_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        INDIVIDUALID,
        COUNT(*) as record_count,
        SUM(CASE WHEN TARGET = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as success_count,
        MIN(PURCHASE_DATE_RANGE) as first_purchase,
        MAX(PURCHASE_DATE_RANGE) as last_purchase,
        COUNT(DISTINCT BUBBLES) as unique_bubbles
    FROM DM_CAMPAIGN
    GROUP BY INDIVIDUALID
)
SELECT 
    record_count,
    COUNT(*) as num_individuals,
    SUM(success_count) as total_successes,
    ROUND(AVG(success_count) * 100, 2) as success_rate,
    AVG(last_purchase - first_purchase) as avg_date_range,
    AVG(unique_bubbles) as avg_unique_bubbles
FROM individual_stats
GROUP BY record_count
ORDER BY record_count
LIMIT 20
```

Your initial reasoning was:
This query aims to understand the pattern of multiple records per individual, which was a key finding from the first query. Specifically, it will help us:

1. Understand the distribution of records per individual (are most people contacted twice? Or do some have many more contacts?)

2. See if success rate correlates with number of contacts (do people who are contacted more have higher conversion rates?)

3. Examine the time span of interactions through PURCHASE_DATE_RANGE (are multiple records spread out over time or clustered?)

4. Look at the diversity of 'BUBBLES' per individual (are people being targeted across different categories?)

This analysis will help reveal:
- Whether multiple contacts are a deliberate targeting strategy or random
- If there's an optimal number of contacts for conversion
- The typical timespan of customer relationships
- How diverse the targeting is for individual customers

The results will guide whether we should:
- Consider the sequence of contacts in our analysis
- Treat multiple records as independent or related events
- Focus on customer journey analysis
- Look more deeply into specific bubbles or targeting strategies

The query returned a DataFrame with 10 rows and 6 columns.
Here's a sample of the results (showing first 5 rows):
