  "reasoning": "This query aims to understand the pattern of multiple records per individual, which was a key finding from the first query. Specifically, it will help us:\n\n1. Understand the distribution of records per individual (are most people contacted twice? Or do some have many more contacts?)\n\n2. See if success rate correlates with number of contacts (do people who are contacted more have higher conversion rates?)\n\n3. Examine the time span of interactions through PURCHASE_DATE_RANGE (are multiple records spread out over time or clustered?)\n\n4. Look at the diversity of 'BUBBLES' per individual (are people being targeted across different categories?)\n\nThis analysis will help reveal:\n- Whether multiple contacts are a deliberate targeting strategy or random\n- If there's an optimal number of contacts for conversion\n- The typical timespan of customer relationships\n- How diverse the targeting is for individual customers\n\nThe results will guide whether we should:\n- Consider the sequence of contacts in our analysis\n- Treat multiple records as independent or related events\n- Focus on customer journey analysis\n- Look more deeply into specific bubbles or targeting strategies"
