You have just run the following SQL query as part of your database exploration:

```sql
WITH bubble_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        BUBBLES,
        COUNT(*) as total_contacts,
        COUNT(DISTINCT INDIVIDUALID) as unique_individuals,
        SUM(CASE WHEN TARGET = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successes,
        AVG(CONFIDENCE_LEVEL) as avg_confidence,
        COUNT(CREDIT_RATING) / COUNT(*) as credit_coverage,
        COUNT(PART_AFFILIATION) / COUNT(*) as political_coverage,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN PRES_KIDS = TRUE THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*) as kids_ratio,
        MODE(HH_INCOME) as typical_income
    FROM DM_CAMPAIGN
    GROUP BY BUBBLES
),
bubble_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        *,
        ROUND((successes::FLOAT / unique_individuals) * 100, 2) as success_rate,
        ROUND((total_contacts::FLOAT / unique_individuals), 2) as avg_contacts_per_individual
    FROM bubble_stats
)
SELECT *
FROM bubble_metrics
ORDER BY success_rate DESC
LIMIT 15
```

Your initial reasoning was:
This query builds on our previous findings in several important ways:

1. We learned that bubbles seem to be a key targeting dimension (most individuals stay in one bubble), but we haven't analyzed bubble-specific performance.

2. We discovered significant missing data patterns in credit_rating and political_affiliation, so this query examines if these gaps vary by bubble, which could indicate systematic data collection differences.

3. Given the strong correlation between multiple contacts and success, we calculate avg_contacts_per_individual for each bubble to see if contact intensity varies systematically.

4. We include demographic indicators (kids_ratio, typical_income) and confidence_level to understand if certain bubbles target specific demographic segments.

Specific insights we hope to gain:
- Which bubbles have the highest success rates and how do they differ in contact strategy?
- Are there systematic differences in data completeness across bubbles?
- Do successful bubbles share common demographic characteristics?
- Is there a relationship between confidence_level and success rate?

This analysis will help identify:
- Most effective targeting segments
- Data quality patterns across different customer segments
- Whether successful bubbles share common characteristics that could inform future targeting
- Potential bias in data collection across different customer segments

The query returned a DataFrame with 15 rows and 11 columns.
